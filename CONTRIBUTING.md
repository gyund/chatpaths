# How to Contribute

First off, thank you for contributing! We're excited to collaborate with you! ðŸŽ‰

The following is a set of guidelines for the many ways you can join our collective effort.

Before anything else, please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). We expect all participants, from full-timers to occasional tinkerers, to uphold it.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, and Suggesting Features

Have a suggestion or feedback? Please go to [Issues](https://github.com/gyund/chatpaths/issues) and [open a new issue](https://github.com/gyund/chatpaths/issues/new). Prefix the title with a category like _"Bug:"_, _"Question:"_, or _"Feature Request:"_. Screenshots help us resolve issues and answer questions faster, so thanks for including some if you can.

## Submitting Code Changes

We use [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to maintain a consistent code style consistent. Please run the `spotlessCheck` gradle task to check for any issues with your code (which can be fixed with `spotlessApply`).

### Kotlin

All features should be written in Kotlin.


### Prefer Coroutines to RxJava

When deciding between implementing something using RxJava and Coroutines, please use coroutines.


### Continuous Integration

When opening a PR from a fork, some of the CI checks must be manually triggered by a member of the team. That means you don't need to worry if some of the CI checks are not runningâ€”we'll take care of it when we review the PR and, if there are any issues, we'll let you know.

### PR merge policy

* PRs require one reviewer to approve the PR before it can be merged to the base branch
* We keep the PR git history when merging (merge via "merge commit")
* The reviewer who approved the PR may merge it right after approval (without waiting for the PR author) if all checks are green.
